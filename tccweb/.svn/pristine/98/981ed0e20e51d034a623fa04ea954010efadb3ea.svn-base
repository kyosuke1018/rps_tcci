     * Sorts the specified list into ascending order, according to the
     * {@linkplain Comparable natural ordering} of its elements.
     * All elements in the list must implement the {@link Comparable}
     * interface.  Furthermore, all elements in the list must be
     * <i>mutually comparable</i> (that is, {@code e1.compareTo(e2)}
     * must not throw a {@code ClassCastException} for any elements
     * {@code e1} and {@code e2} in the list).
     *
     * <p>This sort is guaranteed to be <i>stable</i>:  equal elements will
     * not be reordered as a result of the sort.
     *
     * <p>The specified list must be modifiable, but need not be resizable.
     *
     * <p>Implementation note: This implementation is a stable, adaptive,
     * iterative mergesort that requires far fewer than n lg(n) comparisons
     * when the input array is partially sorted, while offering the
     * performance of a traditional mergesort when the input array is
     * randomly ordered.  If the input array is nearly sorted, the
     * implementation requires approximately n comparisons.  Temporary
     * storage requirements vary from a small constant for nearly sorted
     * input arrays to n/2 object references for randomly ordered input
     * arrays.
     *
     * <p>The implementation takes equal advantage of ascending and
     * descending order in its input array, and can take advantage of
     * ascending and descending order in different parts of the same
     * input array.  It is well-suited to merging two or more sorted arrays:
     * simply concatenate the arrays and sort the resulting array.
     *
     * <p>The implementation was adapted from Tim Peters's list sort for Python
     * (<a href="http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/listsort.txt">
     * TimSort</a>).  It uses techiques from Peter McIlroy's "Optimistic
     * Sorting and Information Theoretic Complexity", in Proceedings of the
     * Fourth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pp 467-474,
     * January 1993.
     *
     * <p>This implementation dumps the specified list into an array, sorts
     * the array, and iterates over the list resetting each element
     * from the corresponding position in the array.  This avoids the
     * n<sup>2</sup> log(n) performance that would result from attempting
     * to sort a linked list in place.
     *
     * @param  list the list to be sorted.
     * @throws ClassCastException if the list contains elements that are not
     *         <i>mutually comparable</i> (for example, strings and integers).
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the specified list's
     *         list-iterator does not support the {@code set} operation.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException (optional) if the implementation
     *         detects that the natural ordering of the list elements is
     *         found to violate the {@link Comparable} contract
